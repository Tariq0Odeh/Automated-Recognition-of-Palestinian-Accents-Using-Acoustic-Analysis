# Acoustic Palestinian Regional Accent Recognition System

## Project Description

Develop a simple acoustic Palestinian regional accent recognition system. The project focuses on identifying the accent of a speaker from a short speech segment among four accents: Jerusalem, Nablus, Hebron, and Ramallah. The system will be based on acoustic features extracted from speech for accent recognition.

### 1. System Functionalities

The accent recognition system will:

1. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Extract acoustic features from speech segments.
   
2. **Model Training:**
   - Train models using extracted features from training data.
   
3. **Accent Recognition:**
   - Classify speech segments into one of the four accents.

4. **Performance Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate system performance using accuracy on the testing data.

### 2. Dataset

Download the following speech datasets (.wav files) for the four selected regions (accents):

## How to Run

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
- Run the main Python script to start the accent recognition system.
